# CarbonFiberShockLoading
I analyze parachute opening shock loads on composite rocket tanks by extracting deceleration from flight data, deriving parachute deployment behavior from impulse curves and checking the implied opening shock factor. These shock loads are combined with internal pressure in a laminate stress model to evaluate possible bulkhead or material failure.
